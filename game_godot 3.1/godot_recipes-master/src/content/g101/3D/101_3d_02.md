In the last part, we started a 3D
project and looked at how to navigate and create 3D objects. In this part, you'll
learn how to import existing 3D objects that you've made or downloaded and how
to use more of Godot's 3D nodes.

## Importing 3D Objects

If you're familiar with 3D modeling software such as Blender, you can make your
own models to use in your game. If not, there are many sources where you can
download objects or even collections of objects for particular game types. One
of our favorite makers of free game art is [Kenney.nl](https://kenney.nl/).

For our tutorials, we're going to use Kenney's _Platformer Kit_, which you can
download here: [https://kenney.nl/assets/platformer-kit](https://kenney.nl/assets/platformer-kit)

This kit has a wide selection of objects that we can use to practice our Godot
3D skills. Here's a sample showing what the kit looks like:

Once you've downloaded the kit, you'll find that the objects inside are provided
in a variety of different formats. Godot is able to use several of these, but
since GLTF is available in this pack, it's preferred over the others. Copy the
"GLTF Format" folder into your Godot project's folder and rename it to "platformer
kit".

{{% notice tip %}}
If you're interested in the differences between the formats, here's a brief
summary: _OBJ_ files are the simplest, each representing a mesh which you can
load into a `MeshInstance` node. This is likely the most common file type
you'll find online. _DAE_ (Collada) files are more robust -
Godot loads them as individual scenes, and they can include additional data
along with the mesh such as animations. _GLTF_ files are similar, but represent
a more modern format with additional features.

When you switch back to your Godot window, you'll see progress bar while Godot
scans the folder and imports all of the objects. Let's click on one of them to
see what's going on. In the "FileSystem" tab, select the "crate.glb" and then
click on the "Import" tab:

Here you can see the cube object will be imported as a scene, with its root type
set to `Spatial` and named "Scene Root". Let's change these: set the root type
to `RigidBody` and the root name to "Crate", then click the "Reimport" button.

Now double-click on "crate.glb" and confirm that you want to make a new inherited
scene. Here we have a classic game object: the crate. The root node of the scene
is a `RigidBody` named "Crate" just as we wanted. However, there's one small
problem: it seems Kenney exported this model with an offset:

It would much better if the crate were centered relative to the parent node, so
that when the `RigidBody` rotates about its center, so will the mesh. To fix
this, select the `MeshInstance` node and set its _Translation_ property to
`(-0.5, -0.25, 0.5)`.

Finally, we need to add a collision shape to the body. Add a `CollisionShape`
node as a child of the `Crate`. In its _Shape_ property, choose "New BoxShape".
Use the three handles (they look like orange circles) to size the box to fit
the mesh. You can also set the extents directly in the Inspector:

Note that since the crate is 0.5 units wide, the _Extents_, which represent the
distance from the center, becomes 0.25 units.

Now we're finished setting up the object. Save your `Crate` scene and let's
see how we can use it.

## Building a 3D Scene

Create a new scene with a `Spatial` root. The first child we'll add is one to
give us a "ground" to stack some crates on. Add a `StaticBody` called "Ground",
and to that add a `MeshInstance`. In the _Mesh_ property, select "New PlaneMesh"
and then click it to open its properties. Set _Size_ to `(10, 10)` so that we
have a nice large surface. However, it would look better if it weren't plain
white.

Also in the mesh properties is a _Material_ property. Materials are how you
define the appearance of an object. Select "New SpatialMaterial" and then click
it to open a large list of properties. To set the color of the mesh, we need
the _Albedo_ property. Choose a color, such as brown or dark green.

If we add a crate, it will fall right through the mesh, so we also need to give
it a collision shape. With the crate, we added a `CollisionShape` node and
assigned a shape. That's one way to add collision, let's look at another:
select the mesh and in the menu at the of the viewport, choose "Create
Convex Collision Sibling". This will automatically create a `CollisionShape`
node as a sibling of the mesh and assign it a shape that matches the mesh.

Now instance a few crates in the scene and arrange them in a rough stack. Add
a `Camera` and place it where it has a good view of the crates. Run the scene
and watch your crates go tumbling!

### Rotating Camera

Let's make the camera a little more dynamic by having it slowly orbit around the
scene. Add a `Spatial`, which will be located at `(0, 0, 0)` and name it
"CameraHub". In the scene tree, drag the camera to make it a child of this new
`Spatial`. Now, if the `Spatial` rotates around the **y** axis, it will drag
the camera along with it.

Add a script to the root node and add the following:

{{< highlight gdscript>}}
extends Spatial

func _process(delta):
    $CameraHub.rotate_y(0.01)
{{< /highlight >}}

Run the scene to see what happens.

### Lighting

There's another thing we can add to the scene to improve how it looks: light.
There are multiple light nodes available in 3D, but we're going to start with
`DirectionalLight`. Add one to the scene and use the green (**Y**) arrow to
pull it up into the air.

A `DirectionalLight` simulates an infinite number of parallel rays of light, as
if from a distant source like the sun. It will not cast shadows by default; to
add shadows, click _Enabled_ in the "Shadow" section. There is also a
"DirectionalShadow" section, which contains a number of advanced properties for
fine-tuning the shadow appearance. For full details see [this document](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/tutorials/3d/lights_and_shadows.html).

Note that it really doesn't matter where you place the node - only the
direction of the light arrow matters.

## Wrapping Up

In this tutorial you learned how to import 3D objects from outside sources, and
how to combine them into a simple scene. We also investigated lights and moving
cameras.

In the next part, we'll look at how to build a more complex scene and include
a player-controlled character.
