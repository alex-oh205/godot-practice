Earlier, we saw how to design a 3D environment using imported models. But what
if you want to make something like a room, with walls, doors, ramps, and other
features, but you don't have any models handy? CSG to the rescue!

## What is CSG?

CSG stands for **Constructive Solid Geometry**. It allows you to combine primitive shapes to build complex geometry. Shapes can be combined with boolean operations such as _Union_, _Intersection_, and _Subtraction_.

CSG is a great tool for prototyping environments and game objects. Later in this tutorial, we'll use it to make a small FPS-style level with some ramps,
walls and platforms.

Before we do that, let's get introduced to how the CSG nodes work.

## CSG Basics

Create a new scene with a `Spatial` root, then add a child node and type "CSG"
in the search box.

These are the available CSG shapes. Choose a `CSGBox` to start. You'll see a
plain cube mesh with the following properties:

The _Operation_ property is the one that determines how CSG shapes will be
combined. The options are:

* **Union** - The shapes will be merged, removing any "inside" geometry.
* **Intersection** - Only the intersecting (overlapping) geometry will be kept.
* **Subtraction** - The second shape is "cut out" of the first.

CSG operations are performed on a shape by adding children. Add a child `CSGCylinder` to the `CSGBox`. Drag the top size handle (orange dot) to make it a bit taller. You can also increase the _Sides_ property to make it look more circular (here it's set to `20`):

By default, the shape's operation is set to "Union". The cylinder shape is
being "added" to the cube. Try changing it to "Intersection":

And "Subtraction":

Hopefully you're already seeing the possibilities of creating complex shapes
through these 3 operations.

### CSGCombiner

This node is an "empty" shape. It's used to organize your shapes. Children of
a `CSGCombiner` will be combined following the same rules as above.

## Building a Room

Now we're going to make something useful: a large room with some obstacles and
features that our character can interact with, and that we can use in the upcoming tutorials. Make a new scene with a `Spatial` root that we can start working with.

Start with a `CSGBox`, and set its _Width_ and _Depth_ to `20` and its _Height_
to `5`. We need this to be a box that we go inside, so click the _Invert Faces_
property as well. This reverses the shape so that the solid walls are on the
inside rather than the outside. Also check the _Use Collision_ property, so that
the physics engine will treat this shape as a static body object.

Add an instance of the player character and test that you can walk around in
your new room.

You may remember that in the last part we added code to capture/release the
mouse. You'll need to copy that code over to this scene as well.

### Adding features

Now let's add some features - some internal walls, a ledge running around the
edge with a ramp, and so on. Feel free to get creative and add your own ideas.
Here are a few to get started:

If you use a `CSGCombiner` for each of these objects it will be easier to
organize and duplicate them. Make sure to enable _Use Collision_ on it.

* Wall with door

Add a `CSGBox` and set its _Width_ to `0.5` and its _Height_ to `5` (the same
height as the original room). Make the depth about half the size of the room.
You can enable snapping here to make it easier to align.

Add another `CSGBox` as a child and set it to "Subtract". Size it to resemble
a door. You can also use a cylinder shape to get an arched portal.

* Ramp

For the ramp, we'll use a `CSGPolygon`. This CSG shape lets you extrude a given
polygon to a desired depth. The default shape is a square, but you can add or
remove points. For a ramp, we want 3 points.

After adding the `CSGPolygon`, you can click the _Polygon_ property to adjust
its number of points. After that, you can drag the three points to whatever
location you like. To ensure everything lines up, you can type the coordinates into the Inspector:

In this picture, we've created a ramp and added a couple of `CSGBox` shapes to
make the ledge.

### Putting it together

Make sure to add a `Material` to your shapes, choosing an _Albedo_ color that
seems pleasant to you. In the following examples, we've picked a tan color.

Here's an example of a possible room setup:

Hit play and you should be able to walk around the rooms:

The area is featureless right now, but to make things more visually
interesting, you can add individual lights in each room (more about lighting
in a later tutorial). Here's an example of adding some `OmniLight` and `SpotLight` nodes to the scene:

## Wrapping Up

CSG is a powerful tool for building objects directly in Godot without
having to move to another modeling application such as Blender. It can be helpful
if you need to mock up a test level for your game, or for the final
environment. Keep in mind that as the CSG tree becomes more complex, it can
incur a performance penalty. Try to use CSGCombiner to separate your scene
into separate CSG trees to minimize this.

In the next part, we'll look at a popular style of 3D game: first person.
