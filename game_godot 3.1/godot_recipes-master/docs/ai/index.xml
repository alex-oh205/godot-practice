      <title>Chasing the player</title>

      <description>Problem You want an enemy to chase the player.
Solution The first step in getting an enemy to chase the player is to determine what direction the enemy needs to move. To get the vector pointing from A to B, you subtract: B - A. Normalize the result and you have a direction vector.
This makes the solution quite straightforward. Every frame, set the enemy&amp;rsquo;s velocity to point in the direction of the player.</description>

      <title>Path following</title>

      <guid>http://kidscancode.org/godot_recipes/ai/path_follow/</guid>
      <description>Problem You want a character to follow a pre-defined path, such as a guard patrolling or a car following the road.
Solution There are many ways to approach this problem. In this solution, we&amp;rsquo;ll use Godot&amp;rsquo;s Path2D node (or Path for 3D) as a convenient way to draw paths in the editor.
You can add the Path2D as a child of your main scene, your map, or another location that makes sense.</description>

      <title>Changing behaviors</title>
      <link>http://kidscancode.org/godot_recipes/ai/changing_behaviors/</link>

      <guid>http://kidscancode.org/godot_recipes/ai/changing_behaviors/</guid>
      <description>Problem You want your AI-controlled entity to switch between different behaviors.
Solution For this example, we&amp;rsquo;ll assume an enemy with the following behaviors. See the individual recipes for how to make each behavior work.
 Patrol
The &amp;ldquo;Patrol&amp;rdquo; state moves along a pre-defined path (or stands still if there&amp;rsquo;s no path assigned). See Recipe: Path following for details.
 Chase
The &amp;ldquo;Chase&amp;rdquo; state moves the enemy towards the player. See Recipe: Chasing the player for how to make this behavior.</description>

      <title>Homing missile</title>
      <link>http://kidscancode.org/godot_recipes/ai/homing_missile/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://kidscancode.org/godot_recipes/ai/homing_missile/</guid>
      <description>Problem You need a &amp;ldquo;homing missile&amp;rdquo; - a projectile that will seek a moving target.
Solution For this example, we&amp;rsquo;ll use an Area2D node for the projectile. Areas are typically good choices for bullets because we need to detect when they contact something. If you also need a bullet that bounces/ricochets, a PhysicsBody type node might be a better choice.
The node setup and behavior of the missile is the same you would use for a &amp;ldquo;dumb&amp;rdquo; bullet.</description>
