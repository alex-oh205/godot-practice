## Vector Math

2D coordinate system
    example, axis orientation
    show grid, position
    vector as offset from origin == `position` property
    show x/y as well as angle/length
    equivalent vectors - *relative*

Operations
    vectors are *numbers*. Anything you'd do to move on the number line in 1d you can do in 2d on the xy plane or in 3D in space.
    vector vs. scalar
    addition
    subtraction
    scalar mult
    normalize/unit vector

Examples
    movement
    direction/look_at
    facing - dot product
