      <description>Problem You need a camera controller, using mouse or keyboard, that remains level while rotating and following a target.
Solution Try this: take a Camera node and rotate it a small amount around X (the red ring on the gizmo), then a small amount around Z (the blue ring). Now reverse the X rotation and click the &amp;ldquo;Preview&amp;rdquo; button. Observe how the camera is now tilted.
The solution to this problem is to place the camera on a gimbal - a device designed to keep an object level during movement.</description>

      <title>KinematicBody: Movement</title>

      <description>Problem You need a player-controlled 3D kinematic body.
Solution For this recipe, we&amp;rsquo;ll be using this adorable tank model:
You can grab this model on Itch.io: https://gtibo.itch.io/mini-tank or use any other model you&amp;rsquo;d like. We won&amp;rsquo;t be doing anything that&amp;rsquo;s tank-specific here.
We can add the model to the scene, but we&amp;rsquo;ll need a couple of additional nodes:
For the collision shape, we&amp;rsquo;re just going to use a BoxShape aligned and sized with the tank&amp;rsquo;s treads.</description>

      <title>3D Unit Healthbars</title>

      <description>Problem You want a floating &amp;ldquo;healthbar&amp;rdquo; for your 3D game objects (mobs, characters, etc.).
Solution For this solution, we&amp;rsquo;re going to re-use a 2D healthbar based on a TextureProgress node. It&amp;rsquo;s already set up with textures and code for updating the value and color. If you already have something similar, feel free to use it here. In the example, we&amp;rsquo;ll name this scene &amp;ldquo;Healthbar2D&amp;rdquo;.
If you need some assets, here are the three images used in the bar:</description>

      <description>Problem You want to move a 3D object to a clicked position.
Solution We&amp;rsquo;ll start with a flat plane for our world. Our actor will move on this plane.
The actor for this demo is a triangular prism mesh:
Here is the code for the movement. If given a target, the object will turn and move toward it.
extends KinematicBody export var speed = 5 export var gravity = -5 var target = null var velocity = Vector3.</description>

      <title>KinematicBody: align with surface</title>
      <link>http://kidscancode.org/godot_recipes/3d/3d_align_surface/</link>

      <guid>http://kidscancode.org/godot_recipes/3d/3d_align_surface/</guid>
      <description>Problem You need your kinematic body to align with the surface or terrain.
Solution This recipe builds on the basic KinematicBody controller described in the KinematicBody: Movement recipe, so read that one first.
First, we&amp;rsquo;ve added some terrain to the scene. You can download the terrain from here: https://fertile-soil-productions.itch.io/modular-terrain-pack. This is low-poly terrain, but you can use or make any terrain you like for this technique.
As you can see, the movement still works with the terrain, but the tank seems to &amp;ldquo;float&amp;rdquo; above the slopes because it doesn&amp;rsquo;t change its orientation.</description>
